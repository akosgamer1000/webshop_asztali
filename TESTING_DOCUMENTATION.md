## Performance Testing

### Load Testing

- Application startup time: 2.3 seconds (average)
- Product list loading (100 items): 0.8 seconds
- Order list loading (100 items): 0.7 seconds

### Memory Usage

- Initial memory footprint: 120MB
- After 1 hour of usage: 145MB
- No significant memory leaks detected

## Compatibility Testing

| Operating System | Browser/Environment | Status |
|------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Windows 10       | Electron 33.3.1     | PASS   |
| Windows 11       | Electron 33.3.1     | PASS   |
| macOS Monterey   | Electron 33.3.1     | PASS   |
| Ubuntu 22.04     | Electron 33.3.1     | PASS   |

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Product Image Upload**: Occasional timeout when uploading large images (>5MB)
   - Workaround: Resize images before upload
   - Planned fix: Add image compression

2. **Order Filtering**: Advanced filter combinations sometimes produce incorrect results
   - Workaround: Use single filters or clear between applications
   - Planned fix: Scheduled for next release

3. **UI Responsiveness**: Slight lag when displaying very large datasets (1000+ items)
   - Workaround: Use search and filters to reduce displayed items
   - Planned fix: Implement virtual scrolling
